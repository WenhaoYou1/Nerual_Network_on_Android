	abstract = "This paper proposes a block solution method for the Extreme Learning Machine. It combines the speed of a direct non-iterative solver with minimal memory requirements. The method is suitable for edge computing scenarios running on a mobile device with GPU acceleration. The implementation tested on the GPU of iPad Pro outperforms a laptop CPU, and trains a 19,000-neuron model using under one gigabyte of memory. It confirms the feasibility of Big Data analysis on modern mobile devices.",
