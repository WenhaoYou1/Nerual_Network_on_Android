	abstract="This paper proposes a block solution method for the Extreme Learning Machine. It combines the speed of a direct non-iterative solver with minimal memory requirements. The method is suitable for edge computing scenarios running on a mobile device with GPU acceleration. The implementation tested on the GPU of iPad Pro outperforms a laptop CPU, and trains a 19,000-neuron model using under one gigabyte of memory. It confirms the feasibility of Big Data analysis on modern mobile devices.",

	abstract="Over the last years, the computational power of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has grown dramatically, reaching the level of desktop computers available not long ago. While standard smartphone apps are no longer a problem for them, there is still a group of tasks that can easily challenge even high-end devices, namely running artificial intelligence algorithms. In this paper, we present a study of the current state of deep learning in the Android ecosystem and describe available frameworks, programming models and the limitations of running AI on smartphones. We give an overview of the hardware acceleration resources available on four main mobile chipset platforms: Qualcomm, HiSilicon, MediaTek and Samsung. Additionally, we present the real-world performance results of different mobile SoCs collected with AI Benchmark (http://ai-benchmark.com) that are covering all main existing hardware configurations.",
